# New hardware for HPP

## Lab Objectives

HPP is an ever evolving topic, and many approaches at the frontier of this course exist. The lab #3 is dedicated to let you discover trending or established technologies, framework, tools of the utmost practical interest for HPP that we could not practice in the other lab -- we can't implement all HPP technologies. Meantime, it is also intresting to have basic knowledge about such approaches.

As a consequence, Lab #3 is made for you to dive into *one* of this technology/framework/tool, understand what it does and what it does not, what are its limitations, and then share your knowledge with your peers.

We will build group of 2 students, for each group will be assigned ont of the following topics this year :

- Processors
  - Other forms/architecture of computing (quantum...)
  - GPUs
  - TPUs
  - Xeon Phi/Platinium
- Memory
  - Non-Volatile Memory (NVMe)
  - Transactional memory
- Network
  - InfiniBand
- Algorithms
  - Message Passing Interface (MPI) / Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM)
  - Space–time tradeoff / Rainbow_tables

## Topics

The session on the 9th of May is made for you to research and understand your assigned topic as a group.

The session on the 13th of May is made for you to present your assigned topic to the rest of the class.
To this end, you will provide a [slide deck](https://mootse.telecom-st-etienne.fr/mod/assign/view.php?id=16924) for an oral presentation of 15 minutes.

While you are free to propose your own agenda for these presentation, you must provide the following information to the audience for your assigned topic :
- How does the technology/framework works ?
- When does it emerged and will it be still usable in the future in your opinion or shall it be supersedes by something else ?
- What are the situations when to use and when not to use your technology/framework ?
- How much does it costs ? (in hardware price tags, development time, ...)
- Provides illustrative tasks where that technology excels and report what can be the gain in such settings (in the best situation for which it has been designed, what can be gained ?)
