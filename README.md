## How it works

For each session of the course, a notion will be introduced (Data Structure, Algorithms, Archictecture) and will be applied in the following lab.

The general framework of the lab is a maven project that process data from the [DEBS 2015 Grand Challenge](http://www.debs2015.org/call-grand-challenge.html). This challenge contains data from taxi trips in NYC.

You will be asked to answer queries on the data. Each query will reflect the notions seen during the course.
The goal being to answer these queries as fast as possible.
